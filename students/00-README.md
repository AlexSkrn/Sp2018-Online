# Welcome, Students!

When you join the course, please do the following:

1. Create a directory named after you. This is a public repository, so if you want to remain anonymous, you don't need to use your full name.
  * It can be your first name.
  * It can be your GitHub handle.
  * It can be an arbitrary nickname&mdash;just make sure to let your instructor know!

2. Create a README for your directory.
  * Feel free to personalize it a bit! These pages are made with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  * Share some things about what makes you you.
  * Tell us what you want to get out of this course.
  * Who's your favorite figure in the Python community? 
    * [Kenneth Reitz](https://www.kennethreitz.org)?
    * [Diane Chen](http://purplediane.github.io)?
    * [Kenneth Alfred Lambert](http://home.wlu.edu/~lambertk/)?
    * [Anna Makarudze](https://twitter.com/amakarudze)?
    * [Kenneth Love](https://thekennethlove.com)?
  * Protip: [Always start a project with a README](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/how-i-develop-things-and-why). 
    What if Two-Years-Older-*You* forgets what the project was about?
