# Student McStudentFace

This directory serves as an example for a student's classwork directory.

It is named with a "00" at the beginning to force it to top of file
listings. This is for our organizational purposes, and your ease of use for
this course. Don't mistake this as a common practice, because `README` is the
standard name for files like this.

Each student will create their own, similar directory, and then use it to manage
their classwork using git and [a workflow explained in our
resources](https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/PythonCertDevel/blob/master/source/modules/GitWorkflow.rst).
You'll submit it to the instructors for review.

Some especially beginner-friendly guides include:
* GitHub's [TryGit](https://try.github.io).
* the [official tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics),
* [gitready](http://gitready.com),
