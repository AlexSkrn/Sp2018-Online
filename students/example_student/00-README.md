# Student McStudentFace

This directory serves as an example for a student's classwork directory.

It is named with a "00" at the beginning to force it to top of file
listings. This is for our organizational purposes, and your ease of use for
this course. Don't mistake this as a common practice, because `README` is the
standard name for files like this.

Each student will create their own, similar directory, and then use it to manage
their classwork. You'll submit it to the instructors for review.

For each exercise, please do the following:

1. Create a new directory for that exercise.
2. Put your solution in that directory as you would normally.
3. Add them to your git repo.
  * `git add --help` if you don't know how to do this.
  * `git add --all` may be useful sometimes, but be careful with it.
4. Commit your changes
  * `git commit --help` if you don't know how to do this.
5. Push to your fork on GitHub.
  * `git push`, then enter your GitHub credentials
  * There is an alternative method using cryptographic signatures to verify your
    identity, but that is not strictly necessary.

This might seem a bit complex at the moment, but it will become second nature.

Try running our example exercise!
