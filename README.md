# Class Repository Template

**WARNING** This is a template -- it is not an actual class repo. Students should find the proper repo for their class, and make a fork of that.

This is a repo that serves as a template for a repository for a particular
instance of a class for the UWPCE Python Certificate.

A copy of this repo will be made for each class, so that it can be used by the class to share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

`examples`: Used to put example code, etc in for the class.

`solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises

`students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create a directory in the students directory in which to put their work.
