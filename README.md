# Class Repository Template

This is a repo that serves as a template for a repository for a particular
instance of a class for the [UWPCE Python Certificate](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming).

Make a copy of this repo for each class, so that it can be used by the class to
share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

* `examples`: Used to store example code and example documents for the class.

* `solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises.

* `students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create
a directory, then store work for each exercise in a subdirectory of that.
