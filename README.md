# Spring Online Class Repository

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

* `examples`: Used to store example code and example documents for the class.

* `solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises.

* `students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create
a directory, then store work for each exercise in a subdirectory of that.
