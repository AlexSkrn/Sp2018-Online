# Class Repository Template

This is a repo that serves as a template for a repository for a particular
instance of a class for the UWPCE Python Certificate.

Make a copy of this repo for each class, so that it can be used by the class to
share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

* `examples`: Used to put example code, etc in for the class.

* `solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises

* `students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create
a directory in the students directory in which to put their work.
